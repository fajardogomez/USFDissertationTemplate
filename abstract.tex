%% Include an abstract
\begin{abstract}
This project aims to at least reduce the workload as you write your dissertation. The main body of the chapters included as examples also include instructions. I can't make any promises that the reviewers won't find something for you to fix that the template missed. If that happens to you, and you think others will benefit from the necessary changes, you can submit an issue on \href{https://github.com/fajardogomez/USFDissertationTemplate}{GitHub}. There are more instructions and some style tips there in case you'd find them useful.

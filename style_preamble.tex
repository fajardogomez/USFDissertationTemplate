% ETD guidelines suggest you can either indent all paragraphs or none. An argument can be made that paragraphs immediately after a section heading do not need to be indented* and this is the default LaTeX behavior. if you feel strongly about it, do not load the indentfirst package and talk to your ETD reviewer about your choice. At time of writing (Summer 2022), they seem to be willing to be lenient as long as the choices for indentation are consistent throughout the document. 

% *Chicago manual of style points out these are often flush left, and this appears to be a common choice among US/UK typographers, though it is not universal (MLA prefers ALL paragraphs without exception to be indented). You can choose your own (unless ETD reviewers are adamant about a particular choice)

% Entirely optional, though it improves navigation for the readers of electronic documents. ETD guidelines at time of writing (Summer 2022) do not mention hyperlink formatting and reviewers seem to decide if they fit on a case by case basis. 
% If you are not attached (like I am) to hyperlinks, comment it out. If you want hyperlinks but want to avoid a round of formatting revisions, consider making all links black (i.e. citecolor=black,linkcolor=black, etc.). If you are determined, talk to ETD reviewers about your use of hyperlinks, they may let it slide.

\chapter{First}
This is the first appendix, labeled with alphabetic counters. Appendices are chapters included after the \verb|\appendix| command in the main \tt{.tex} file. If you add more than one, and they are long, you may want to separate the inputs into several files. Otherwise just include them all here as different chapters.
